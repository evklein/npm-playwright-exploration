# Playwright Exploration, in Node

I wanted to learn some techniques for automating end-to-end testing with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), so I'm documenting that work here in this repo.

The sample project I'm using as a base is [andrewagain's React Calculator app](https://github.com/andrewagain/calculator). I'm going to avoid modifying the underlying source code if possible, so the majority of the work in this repo will be documented in `tests/`.
